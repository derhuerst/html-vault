# [html-vault](https://html-vault.jannisr.de/) üîê

**Store a secret securely in a standalone HTML file.** Encrypts any message/secret and generates something that can decrypt itself. I see mainly two advantages of this HTML-based solution over others:

- **low entry-barrier** ‚Äì Everyone with a reasonably modern browser will be able to use the tool, without installing anything. It is also more platform-independent than other solutions.
- **self-contained** ‚Äì The generated self-decrypting page contains all the logic it needs to decrypt the encrypted messages it contains. It can be easily stored as a file and requires no further tooling (which might break or change) to work.

Used [`self-decrypting-html-page`](https://github.com/derhuerst/self-decrypting-html-page#self-decrypting-html-page) under the hood.
